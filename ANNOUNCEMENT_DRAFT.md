# 🚀 The Pledge Delivered: The Intent Recognition Agent is Live

Hi team,

A few days ago, we made a pledge: to not just write about the frontier of "simulated worlds" and agentic marketing, but to build it with you. We promised to open source the **Intent Recognition Agent** based on our *Geometry of Intention* research.

**Today, we are delivering on that promise.**

The repo is open. The playground is open. The future is here.

## 🎁 What We've Built (and What You Can Use Right Now)

We have released the **Intent Recognition Agent Starter Kit**, fully compatible with the Model Context Protocol (MCP). This isn't just a chatbot; it's a cognitive architecture for understanding *why* your customers act.

### 1. The Core Engine (Layers 1 & 2)
We've implemented the **Context-Conditioned Intent Recognition** engine. It takes raw user signals (clicks, scrolls, history) and uses LLMs to infer the human intention behind them—distinguishing the "anxious researcher" from the "impulse buyer" with surgical precision.

### 2. Pattern Discovery (Layer 3)
We've included the full **Pattern Discovery** pipeline. Upload your raw session data, and watch as the system uses behavioral embeddings and HDBSCAN to discover latent audience personas you didn't know existed.

### 3. Fully MCP-Compatible
This is built for the agentic era. We've included standalone MCP servers for both Intent Recognition and Pattern Discovery. You can plug these tools directly into Cursor, Claude Desktop, or your own agent swarms.

### 4. Live Playground
You don't have to install anything to see it in action. We've deployed a full Gradio app on Hugging Face Spaces:

*   **Bring Your Own Key**: We've added a secure LLM panel where you can plug in your own Anthropic, OpenAI, or OpenRouter keys (including free models!) to test the system with your preferred intelligence.

## 🚧 The Road Ahead: What's Still to Build

We are building this *with* you. We have laid the foundation (Layers 1-3), but the "Action System" (Layer 4) is where the rubber meets the road.

**Coming Soon (and where we need your help):**
*   **Activation Playbooks**: Connecting these intent signals directly to ad platforms (Google/Meta APIs).
*   **Bid Optimization**: Logic to calculate dynamic bid modifiers based on intent confidence.
*   **Dynamic Personalization**: Real-time content swapping based on recognized personas.

You can read the full vision for these layers in our [research article](docs/article.md).

## ⚡ Your Turn: Build the Future

The "sim world" is open, and there are 10 days left in the Hackathon. This is your toolkit.

1.  **Explore the App**: Go to the [Hugging Face Space](https://huggingface.co/spaces/Dessi/gradio-mcp-hack), break it, test it, find the edges.
2.  **Contribute Ideas**: How would *you* activate these signals? Join the discussion on our [GitHub Discussions](https://github.com/orgs/ai-knowledge-hub/discussions).
3.  **Share Your Builds**: If you're using this for the Hackathon, show us! We want to amplify your work.

We started this because we believe marketing is evolving from "optimizing campaigns" to **architecting intelligence**. The tools are in your hands.

Let’s go build.
